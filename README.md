# Dual-Mode-LED-Matrix-Controller
Arduino project that controls a square on an 8×8 LED matrix using either a joystick or an IR remote. A 16×2 LCD shows the active mode, which can be toggled by a button or remote. The joystick allows smooth movement with auto-centering, while the remote enables directional control.
